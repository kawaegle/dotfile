# Kawaegle dotfiles

## Introduction
These are my dotfiles I use as a daily driver. It contains config files for kitty and nvim mostly, but you can also find configs for ZSH, ranger or mvp. In `script`, you can find little scripts I did too.

## Documentation
I'm currently working on documentation. As soon as these dots were originally made for me, I didn't take the time to comment them really well, neither document them.
But you can already find my NVim's configuration documentation [here](nvim/README.md), and my zsh config [here](zsh/README.md).

## GDB
I use GDB [pwndbg](https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg) plugins so make sure you have it too (and installed at the same place).

## rizin (WIP)
Rizin configuration that is maybe effective on cutter
