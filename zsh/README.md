## ZSH configuration

there is my zsh config with alias, script and env manager

### Plugins
#### sudo
maybe the most usefull plugin that allow you to use `<esc><esc>` to toggle sudo in front of your current or latest command.
#### calc
let you do some math calcul inside your shell without needed ugly shell operator (with calc or = alias)
#### colored-man-pages
add some color in ~~~your life~~~ man pages
#### countdown
manage a counter with update of time passed (mostly for pomodoro in my case)
#### extract A.K.A x
a tool to extract many file only using x instead of remenber how to do it with tool like tar, zip, and many more
#### git prompt
show a beautifull git prompt when inside a git repository that show the status of the repos (staged files, added files, deleted files, untracked files and branches).
#### listbox 
because when your script are sexy it's cool

### Themes manager
as OH MY ZSH it seem cool to let everybody custom their shell prompt and as ohmyzsh themes are only zsh shell script I decide to manage themes like that inside a folder and an env variables inside zshrc file
