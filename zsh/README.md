## ZSH

### alias
all alias I need to get the work done

### themes
my poor attempt to create zsh prompts themes (and steal some to ohmyzsh)

### zshrc
the main zsh file that source all other file I need.

### plugins
- calc: allow zsh to understand and do arthmical operation
- colored-man-pages: because color on man is sexy
- compressor: script that create more easly archive of all kind
- countdown: setup a countdown that return true
- extract: aliased on `x`, allow user to extract most of compressed file without pain
- gitprompt: for my themes get all element from got repository (mostly change)
- listbox: select with interactive choice
- sudo: add/remove sudo in front of command by ESC ESC sequence
- tmux: manage tmux better

### Environment
Manage my environment variable in a file so I don't stick on a specific file architecture.
